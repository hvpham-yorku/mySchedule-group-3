Since sprint1, we decided as a group to not have a PB.md file since we thought it would be sufficient if we were to only use trello. As a result, when looking back at the documents, we do not have a PB.md file in sprint0 since that was done on trello and relevent documents were mentioned in various other areas like personans.pdf. We did include a trello link as shown below.

Amazingly, we were able to finish all the assigned tasks for the user stories so we did not need to update the PB.md or the Trello equivalent to add more user stories for the uncompleted tasks and as a result no changes were made to the PB.md
