The participants in the meeting
 ● Unfinished tasks and group them into stories; add them to SR1.md in the form of new user 
stories. Update your PB.md and save the updated copy in doc/sprint2 (yes, sprint2 - prepare for the next sprint!)

Note: All tasks in user stories were completed for this sprint. No incomplete tasks.  

 What are practices that you should continue during the next sprint?
 
-Using Trello to keep track of user stories/features that could be added for the next sprint.
-Staying active on Discord to keep up-to-date with the project, and have meetings regularly.
-Hold regular sessions to review code for functionality, readability, and adherence to set standards.  

 What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint 

-Complete the tasks ahead of time so we don’t feel rushed to finish on the last day.
-Schedule more frequent meetings to review code, identify errors, and share feedback within the team. People in the group should ask questions or help each other more when needed.
-Define and communicate task priorities at the start of the sprint to ensure that team members know what exactly to focus on first. 

 What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during the next sprint?
-Lack of proper Time Management: Due to members’ busy schedules, it was often difficult to set clear or hard deadlines causing task management to be cumbersome. 

What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1?
Best Experience:
-Gaining hands-on experience with full-stack development. As a result of limited prior knowledge in full-stack development, the team had to do some intensive research - using resources available to us to deliver a functional program. 
Worst Experience: 
-Debugging issues with React code and backend-frontend connectivity issues in Node.js. Port 5000, which was used for MongoDB conflicted with system processes on non-Windows OS(Linux/MacOS). This was resolved by switching to port 6000.
