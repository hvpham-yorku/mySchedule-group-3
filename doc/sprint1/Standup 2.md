# Standup 2025 03-18\] \- Sprint 1 Standup 2

1\. What did you work on since the last standup?

*  Focused on getting all the documentation completed RPM, sprint1, and the user stories and finishing up more user stories (Edit task, filter task by status), and implementing a connection to the database (MongoDB).

2\. What do you commit to next? 

* Solidifying the database connection with the code, finalizing all the user stories and completed documents and getting to work on the sprint demo and the system architecture documents.

3\. When do you think you'll be done? 

* The goal is to be done as soon as possible, but the majority of items listed could be done by a day from now or two.

4\. Do you have any blockers?

* No blockers, except for github not being able to push or commit files as needed so group members have to share files between each other.
