# sprintN.md

Meeting Date: 2025, 03-17

Participants: Chivuzo(Edwin) Product Owner, Aleem \- Software Developer, Samuel \- Software Developer,  Alex \- Software Developer

Sprint Goal: The main sprint goal of this sprint is to give users basic functionality when it comes to various features like adding/creating a task, modifying a task, deleting a task, sorting tasks, listing/displaying a task, and marking tasks as completed.

Potential Issues/Spikes: Some spikes that might come up are finding efficient ways to modify and delete tasks and finding the best way to store them in addition to the layout of the GUI and how best to implement user interfaces to make an easy-to-use and smooth design for the user.

Team Capacity: The total amount of hours the team is able to supply is around 30 on average per week for sprint 1 with each individual providing around 7-8 hours per person. However, the workload may fluctuate per person as needed depending on the amount of work assigned and completed given that some user stories are not needed to be fully completed but instead would be nice to start on/partially completed/fully completed as mentioned below.

Decisions around User Stories: The following user stories that must be completed this sprint based on the sprint goal are.

1) Add a new Task.  
2) Delete Task.  
3) Edit Task.  
4) Filter Tasks by status.  
5) Mark Task as Completed.

In addition, it would be important to at least start if not fully complete the following user stories given their interaction with other user stories and implementation. Since the emphasis for the sprint goal is to develop basic functionality, the following user stories are not a core part of the base application but instead, are good quality of life features/desirable features a user wants in the application:

1) Set Due Date.  
2) Set Task Priority.  
3) Sort Task by Priority.  
4) View Tasks by Due Date.  
5) Add Notes to Tasks.

The rest of the user stories will be left for the next sprint given they are not a part of this sprint's goal and/or are not as closely related to the other user stories. 

Task Breakdown. Each person will be assigned 1-2 user stories that *must be completed* as part of the sprint, in addition to 1-2 user stories to *start on or complete* with their following subtasks and tasks as defined in the Trello website and listed below. 

| Person | User Stories Assigned | Tasks Assigned |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Edwin | Add a new Task Delete Task Add Notes to Tasks | \- Develop a function that can add a task, delete a task and add notes to a task. \- Display the corresponding functions as part of a GUI on the website. \-Establish a connection with the database capturing the required data and fields needed. \-Ensure the following functions work as intended dealing with base and edge cases. |
| Aleem | Filter by status Set Task Priority Sort Task by Priority | \- Develop functions that can sort and set tasks by priority and then filter the task by its status. \- Display the corresponding functions as part of a GUI on the website. \-Establish a connection with the database capturing the required data and fields needed. \-Ensure the following functions work as intended dealing with base and edge cases. |
| Alex | Edit Task Set Due Date | \- Develop functions that can set a due date for a task and edit a tasks (notes, due date, title, and more) \-Establish a connection with the database capturing the required data and fields needed. \- Display the corresponding functions as part of a GUI on the website. \-Ensure the following functions work as intended dealing with base and edge cases. |
| Samuel | Mark Task as Completed View Tasks by Due Date. | \- Develop functions that can mark a task as complete and be able to view a task by the due date. \-Establish a connection with the database capturing the required data and fields needed. \- Display the corresponding functions as part of a GUI on the website. \-Ensure the following functions work as intended dealing with base and edge cases. |
