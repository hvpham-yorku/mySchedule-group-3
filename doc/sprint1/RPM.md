Release Goal: The main release goal is to deliver a fully functional task scheduler that incorporates all features indicated in our user stories such as adding/creating a task, modifying a task, deleting a task, sorting tasks, listing/displaying a task, marking tasks as completed, providing notification and so on. 

Project scope: Based on the release goal, these key features (user stories), are some of the following that would need to be completed and fully functional. 

1) Add a New Task.  
2) Delete Task.  
3) View Task Progress.  
4) Filter Tasks by Status.  
5) Set Task Reminder.  
6) Edit Task.

Product Roadmap: 

By 2025, 03-20, the MySchedule app should have basic functionality and features as mentioned in the sprint goal, allowing users to be able to create/add a task, edit or delete a task, and then sort, list and display a task. 

By 2025, 04-03, the MySchedule app should have full functionality and features with a majority if not all of the user stories completed at that time. In accordance with the release goal, the app will be a task scheduler allowing users the ability to add, delete, and customize tasks accompanied by various features like sorting, filtering, and access to a calendar display.
