Project Objective: Using notes or graphical images/text to help users organize their day. Focusing on user input and interactivity, the application helps users combat forgetfulness, manage their time wisely, and make plans they will follow through.

Key Users: Some of the key users can be anyone who can and needs to use reminders during the day. For example, students, stay-at-home moms, or entrepreneurs can benefit from using reminders and, by extension, our application. 

**Key User:**   
The College Student   
**Use Cases:**

* Keeping track of deadlines for assignments and projects.  
* Setting reminders for social events, club meetings, and extracurricular activities.  
* Organizing a reading schedule for the semester to stay on track with coursework.  
* Scheduling study sessions and breaks to avoid burnout.  
* Setting reminders for tuition payments, library book returns, and other academic responsibilities.

**Key Scenario:**   
Sarah, a second-year engineering student, has multiple assignments due throughout the semester. She inputs all assignment deadlines into the app and sets reminders a few days before each due date. She also schedules reminders for study sessions before exams and syncs her class schedule with the app. When a social event pops up, she checks her schedule to avoid conflicts before committing.

**Key User: The Entrepreneur**  
**Use Cases:** 

* Scheduling meetings and ensuring important client calls are not missed.  
* Block out days for important work sessions or travel.  
* Setting recurring reminders for invoicing, payroll, and financial reviews.  
* Managing networking events, investor meetings, and product launches.  
* Tracking project deadlines and assigning tasks to team members.

**Key Scenarios:**   
Leb is the CEO of a fashion and clothing brand. Since his brand is so popular, meetings with suppliers, retail partners, and internal teams are every day and never-ending. Being such a busy person, he finds it hard to manage his time wisely and would like to find a way to better schedule his day.

**Key Principals:** 

* Ease of use over Complexity: The application should be developed with users in mind, with simple and easy-to-use features in our application compared to having a variety of sophisticated features and complicated user interface layouts that may be hard to use or confusing.

* Quick and Easy Task Management: Users should be able to add tasks with minimal effort, ideally within a few seconds.   
- One-Tap Completion: With a single swipe, a user should be able to mark a task as completed instead of requiring multiple steps.   
* Intuitive User Interface(UI) & User Experience(UX):  
- The design is very clean and uncluttered, allowing users to achieve a goal within minimal time.  
- Consistent layout: Buttons, menus, and input fields should follow a uniform structure to ensure predictability.   
- One Action Per Screen: Each screen should be focused on a single action(e.g, adding a task, setting a reminder) rather than cramming multiple functions into one view.
