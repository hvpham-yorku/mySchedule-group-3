**How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?**   
The team used Discord as our main platform for communication, where we met 2-3 times per week, with consensus on the days when people could be most avaialble. We used Trello, GIMP (storyboard), and Google Docs in order to collaborate. Team roles have not been assigned as of yet, roles will be assigned at the beginning of sprint 1\.

 **How did you make decisions?**   
Decisions were made mainly by consensus. We ensured that at least three members of the team were involved in deciding the approach to take for the project. For example, in Sprint 0, we first discussed how to approach the work and then agreed via consensus that each individual would handle a key component of the project. We later met to review and agree on each other's work before combining everything.

**How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?**  
In the current sprint cycle, the priority for user stories was not formally assigned. However, the group had a general understanding of which user stories were of higher priority and should be completed before lower-priority ones. As a result, no formal rounds of voting were conducted to determine point estimates.

 **How frequently did you meet?**   
On average, we met about 2-3 times per week, following up with check-ins via Discord messages to ensure everyone was on task. Meetings became more frequent toward the end of the sprint, while earlier on, they were less frequent due to individual work assignments.

**What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?**  
For the next phase, we must ensure to start our project earlier and manage our time more effectively. Additionally, we should allocate more time for implementing user stories and project requirements to ensure we have a buffer in case any challenges arise. We should also clearly lay out the tasks for each team member and conduct regular check-ins to keep everyone on track and improve communication.
