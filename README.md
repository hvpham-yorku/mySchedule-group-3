# MySchedule

- Motivation: Our application MySchedule, is a reminders application that helps users plan their day, combat forgetfulness, and help manage time better. It exists because time management and planning are important aspects of daily life.

- Installation: A user will just need to install Java and download the project from GitHub. 

- Contribution: So far we did not use git flow. When it comes to branches none currently exist, but branches will be numbered numerically with change association (e.g. function.update_1). There is a possibility for using GitHub issues but we will look into, further along in development, and we will be using pull requests as a safety precaution.
